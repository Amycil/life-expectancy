## LIFE EXPECTANCY AND GDP ANALYSIS
- The data contains the life expectancy and GDP of six countries(Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA and Zimbabwe) over a period of years,
ranging from 2000 to 2015.


### OBJECTIVE
- The main objective of this project and analysis is to determine if there is a relationship between the life expectancy and GDP of countries, mainly the ones available 
in the data.
- To do this analysis, I extracted the mean values of the GDP and life Expectancy of the countries over the years. And then, plotted both values against each other
per country using facetgrid and scatterplot in seaborn. 
- Also, to find out if there was any growth in GDP of each country over the years, I plotted a line graph to show that trend and same was done for Life expectancy 
for each country as well.
-There is a also a barplot showing life expectancy vs Country.


### FINALLY!!
- There is a written summary of my findimgs after the data visualizations at the end of my codes.
